I measured out each dimension for the pinecil and tried to make a compartment that would fit it perfectly (so that it wouldn't jiggle around in the case). Additionally, I tried to design the case so that it has hotswappable clips for different pinecil tips. Each clip has a similar bottom that should fit perfectly in the slot in the case. Now to check if the clips actually fit with the pinecil tips...
