## 10/9/2025 - Created the Bottom Case in CAD

I measured out each dimension for the pinecil and tried to make a compartment that would fit it perfectly (so that it wouldn't jiggle around in the case). Additionally, I tried to design the case so that it has hotswappable clips for different pinecil tips. Each clip has a similar bottom that should fit perfectly in the slot in the case. Now to check if the clips actually fit with the pinecil tips...  

## 10/10/2025 - Tested Clips & Hinges + Designed Outside of Top Case

First of all, I tested a bunch of different tolerances to get the perfect snap fit for the pinecil tip clips. After 6 tries I got a good one.

For the hinges, I was thinking that I wanted this case to be strong and I want the hinges to be small to make it asthetically pleasing. So, I probably wouldn't be able to use PLA for the entire hinge because it isn't the strongest and it doesn't print that well with smaller pieces. So, I was thinking of small items I could use for the axle, and I thought of a paper clip. The metal wire is pretty strong, I can cut it into smaller pieces, and it should be able to work with PLA hinges. I printed out a few tries, and it actually ended up working! So, I will use this on the final design.

Finally, I designed the outside of the top case. I want the outside to be as sleek and professional as I can, so I put their minimal logo on the front as well as a green border. Both the logo and the border I plan to print separately and glue on later to remove the need for support material (which would scar the face of the case).
