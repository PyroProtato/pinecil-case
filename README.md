A 3D printed case for my pinecil with a few unique features! Uses magnets for closing, paper clips as hinges, and the rest is fully 3D-printed.

I wanted to make this project because I haven't really experimented with snap-fit parts, clean designs, and printabiility in my 3D models thus far since most of them are practical. So, to practice these skills, I decided to design and make a case for my pinecil (which I needed to do anyway). I specifically ensured that no weird parts were used (besides filament only paper clips and magnets). 

 ## BOM:
- (1x) Case Top [3D-Printed]
- (1x) Case Bottom [3D-Printed]
- (2x) Pinecil Clip [3D-Printed]
- (1x) Pinecil Logo [3D-Printed]
- (1x) Pinecil Border [3D-Printed]
- (1x) Standard Paper Clip
- (4-8x) 5mm diameter 2.8mm height magnet

 ## Creation Instructions
3D print all of the STEP files located in the 3DPRINT folder. Make sure that the layer height is set to 0.1mm for the case top and case bottom. Afterwards, assemble by cutting, inserting, and bending paper clips in the hinges, gluing logo and border onto the top case, gluing magnets into the provided holes, and gluing the clips into the indentations on the bottom case. Let it dry, and then the case is done!
